Genome Assembly and Annotation of Salmonella enterica

This repository contains the complete workflow I followed to assemble and annotate the genome of Salmonella enterica using Illumina paired-end sequencing data from the NCBI SRA (accession number: SRR2584863). The goal of this project was to understand how raw sequencing reads are processed through a standard bacterial genome assembly and annotation pipeline. All major output folders from SPAdes, QUAST, and Prokka are included so that the entire workflow can be reviewed or reproduced.

1. Project Summary

The analysis begins with raw paired-end sequencing reads, which are assembled using SPAdes to generate contigs.
The assembly is then evaluated using QUAST, focusing on metrics such as N50, L50, GC content, and contig length distribution.
Finally, the assembled contigs are annotated using Prokka, which identifies coding sequences, RNA genes, and other genomic features.

The repository is organized with separate directories for each tool’s output to keep the workflow clear and easy to navigate.

2. Dataset Information

Organism: Salmonella enterica

SRA Accession: SRR2584863

Platform: Illumina

Data Type: Paired-end whole-genome reads

The FASTQ files are not included due to size, but all analyses were performed using this dataset.

3. Tools Used

SPAdes – de novo genome assembly

QUAST – assembly quality assessment

Prokka – genome annotation

All tools were installed and run through Conda environments to keep the workflow clean and reproducible.

4. Workflow Overview

The workflow followed in this project:

Raw FASTQ files → Genome Assembly (SPAdes) → Assembly Evaluation (QUAST) → Genome Annotation (Prokka)

Each step produces output files, all of which are stored in dedicated folders inside the repository.

5. Results Summary
5.1 QUAST Assembly Results

Total contigs: 421

Contigs ≥ 1000 bp: 214

Largest contig: 151,779 bp

Assembly size: 4,597,936 bp

GC content: 52.16%

N50: 46,503 bp

L50: 30

5.2 Prokka Annotation Results

Protein-coding genes (CDS): 4,256

tRNA genes: 93

rRNA genes: 4

tmRNA: 1

Repeat regions: 2

These results reflect a complete and good-quality bacterial genome assembly and annotation.

6. Repository Structure
README.md
spades_output/       → SPAdes assembled contigs
quast_res/           → QUAST assembly quality reports
prokka_output/       → Prokka genome annotation files


Each folder contains the unmodified outputs generated by their respective tools.

7. Reproducibility

Anyone wishing to reproduce this workflow can do so by installing SPAdes, QUAST, Prokka, and the SRA Toolkit, and following the same sequence of steps.
The pipeline runs smoothly on Linux-based systems, including Ubuntu and WSL.

8. Purpose of This Work

This project was carried out for hands-on practice in microbial genome assembly and annotation. The workflow and results included here may be helpful for students or researchers learning how to perform bacterial genome analysis from start to finish.
